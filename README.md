# Chrome Tab Deduplicator

A simple Chrome tab deduplicating extension. An ongoing project.

Extension icon used from the [Iconoir open-source icon library](https://github.com/lucaburgio/iconoir).

## Why?

While the Chrome web store has many tab management extensions, these extensions:

- Are unmaintained, frequently without updates for 2+ years,
- Are overly complex with ancillary and unrelated features,
- Request unnecessarily broad permissions,
- Are not open-source (no transparency), OR
- Do not support keyboard shortcuts.

I wanted a super simple Chrome extension that I knew was safe to use.

## Usage

To deduplicate open tabs in the current Chrome window:

- Click the extension's icon, OR
- Use the keyboard shortcut:
  - Windows: Ctrl + U
  - Mac: Command + U

## ToDo List

- Add extension pop-up window to configure keyboard shortcut
- Add options to ignore in-page anchor links and query strings when deduplicating
- Submit to Chrome web store
